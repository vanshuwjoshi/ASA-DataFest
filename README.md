# ASA-DataFest
Drug Exposure among Aboriginal people. 
In the ASA DataFest, my team created a data analysis project for getting to know the exposure of drugs or medication without prescription among the aborginal people in Canada. 
We split the data for aboriginal and non-aboriginal people and compared the drug abuse based on different factors such as sex, income, and province.
